# Tesla-TradeIn-Inventory-Analytics
This is a Personal project that I woked on to understand the scope of a Role that I am interviewing.

1. I have first scraped the data of used cars from Tesla used car Inventory.
2. I have used some Ms excel funtions like replace all, remove N/A , and text to columns to make the data ready for multiple regression.
3. I have attached the CSV file for the columns you would need to prepare your data after scraping so you can directly run multiple regression from my code.

Please let me know if the code can be enhanced if you were able to make a more advanced version of this.Since this was made on a short notice it may not
have the required comments and you are most welcome to reachout on vbogawat@horizon.csueastbay.edu if you need to understand any line of code or give any kind of feedback.
